# 👨‍💻 Personal Portfolio - Aleix Ramon

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project was developed to demonstrate my skills in web development and system administration, serving as a central hub for my academic and personal projects.

## 🚀 About the Project

This website is a static site built from scratch using standard web technologies. It features a responsive design, interactive navigation, and a showcase of technical tutorials and projects.

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design:** Adapted for different screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI:** Includes dropdown menus, typewriter effects, and image zoom functionality.
- **Project Showcase:** Detailed step-by-step guides for technical deployments (Linux, GitHub).
- **Contact Simulation:** A functional-looking contact form with JavaScript validation and animation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessible content.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, Flexbox for layout, and animations.
* **JavaScript:**
    * `form.js`: Handles form submission simulation and validation.
    * `typewriter.js`: Adds a dynamic typing effect to headers.
    * `zoom.js`: Enables image zooming for better readability of screenshots.
